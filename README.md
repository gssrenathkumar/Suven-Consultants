<p>Performing Analysis of Meteorological Data</p>

<p>Recognizing Handwritten Digits with scikit-learn</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>In this repository, you will find two projects that I have worked on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Performing Analysis of Meteorological Data</li>
  <li>Recognizing Handwritten Digits with scikit-learn</li>
</ul>

<p>Both projects are related to data analysis and machine learning. The first project involves analyzing meteorological data to gain insights into weather patterns and trends. The second project involves building a machine learning model to recognize handwritten digits using scikit-learn.</p>

<h2>Project Details</h2>

<h3>Performing Analysis of Meteorological Data</h3>

<p>The meteorological data analysis project involves analyzing data from a weather station to gain insights into weather patterns and trends. The project includes the following files:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>data.csv</code>: A CSV file containing the meteorological data.</li>
  <li><code>analysis.ipynb</code>: A Jupyter Notebook that contains the code for analyzing the data and generating visualizations.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some of the visualizations generated by the project:</p>

<h3>Recognizing Handwritten Digits with scikit-learn</h3>

<p>The handwritten digit recognition project involves building a machine learning model to recognize handwritten digits using scikit-learn. The project includes the following files:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>digits.csv</code>: A CSV file containing images of handwritten digits.</li>
  <li><code>model.ipynb</code>: A Jupyter Notebook that contains the code for building the machine learning model and testing it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some examples of the handwritten digits recognized by the model:</p>
